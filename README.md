# ShyFox-Transparent - A modification of ShyFox 3.8.1
ShyFox-Transparent is a customized version of the ShyFox Firefox theme which replaces the opaque browser background with a semi-transparent dark background. This modification builds upon the excellent work of the original ShyFox creators. All instruction instructions remain the same as the original branch.

Changes:
* Modified corner radius variables in shy-variables.css to be slightly smaller
* Changed the background color to a translucent black colour  ```--bg-col:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.74)``` in shy-variables.css

* The image depicted implements [KWin Better Blur](github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix) to generate the window blurring effect.
